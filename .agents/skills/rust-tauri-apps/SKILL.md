# Rust Tauri Apps

Build Tauri v2 applications with small Rust command surfaces, secure capabilities, explicit IPC contracts, and maintainable distribution workflows.

## Operating Model

1. Inspect the Tauri version and generated structure first: `src-tauri`, `tauri.conf.json`, capabilities, permissions, plugins, frontend invocation code, and CI/release scripts.
2. Treat every command as a public bridge contract. Validate input, return typed serializable results, and keep filesystem/shell/network capabilities narrow.
3. Prefer app-owned Rust services behind commands. Do not put large domain logic directly in `#[tauri::command]` functions.
4. Keep the capability model least-privilege by default. Avoid broad filesystem, shell, opener, and dialog permissions unless the user workflow truly needs them.
5. Coordinate with the general `tauri-v2` skill when available for framework-specific current docs; use this skill for Rust architecture, security, testing, and command design.

## Reference Map

- `references/tauri-v2-rust-backend.md` for command/state/plugin architecture and typed IPC.
- `references/capabilities-security.md` for permissions, filesystem/shell risk, secrets, updater, and secure defaults.
- `references/distribution-mobile.md` for bundling, updater, sidecars, signing, desktop/mobile packaging, and release checks.

## Defaults

- Keep commands async only when they await I/O. Do CPU-heavy work off the main runtime.
- Use `serde` DTOs at the IPC boundary and convert to domain types inside services.
- Use `tauri::State` for shared app services with clear ownership; avoid global mutable statics.
- Use plugin APIs instead of hand-rolled platform code when mature official plugins cover the use case.
- Keep frontend-originated paths, URLs, and shell arguments untrusted until validated.

## Verification

Use repo-native checks first, then add Tauri-specific validation:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

For command changes, add Rust tests around service behavior and frontend tests or contract fixtures for IPC shapes when the app already has a frontend test lane.
